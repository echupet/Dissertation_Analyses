	LAGGED = BDI(1); !Created a Lag-1 variable for BDI;

	BETWEEN = Acc_0b age sex; ! accuracy & brain measures are between;

ANALYSIS:
TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM; !Two-Level Model with paths that are latent variables;
ESTIMATOR = BAYES; !Lagged variables can only be estimated with Bayes in Mplus; 
BITERATIONS = (1000); !Run at least 1000 iteration of the MCMC algorithm;

MODEL:
%WITHIN%
phi | BDI ON BDI&1; !BDI is regressed on Lag-1 BDI, the slope is latent;
logv | BDI; !the Within-Level residual variance is latent, sigmaˆ2_i; 

%BETWEEN%
[BDI]; !mean intercept, gamma_00;
[phi]; !mean of autoregressive slope, gamma_10;
[logv]; !log of the mean of the residual variance, omega_0;

BDI; !intercept variance, tau_00;
phi; !autoregressive slope variance, tau_11;
logv; !between-person variance of sigmaˆ2_i not explained by BRAIN;

! acc predicts brain
!ps6_0b on Acc_0b (a);

! acc and brain predict future depression
logv ON Acc_0b age sex;

!MODEL CONSTRAINT:
!NEW(indir1); ! indirect paths: Acc -> brain -> symptoms
!indir1 = b*a;
